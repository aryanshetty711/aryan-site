Arrhythmia detection is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment of various heart diseases. This paper proposes a CNN with an attention wise mechanism to classify two-class and five-class arrhythmia using PTB-XL dataset. Upsampling is used to handle imbalanced features, and cross-validation is employed for evaluation. The model achieves 84.0% and 88.8% accuracy for two-class and five-class arrhythmia detection, respectively, and is compared to four other academic papers. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for arrhythmia identification.
