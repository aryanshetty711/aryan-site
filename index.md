 I'm a second year MSCS student at [NYU Courant](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) - although I'll always be an [Aggie](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html). I like thinking about math, music, photography, intelligence, and philosophy in an order I'm still figuring out.

I'm currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer @ [OpenAds](https://openads.ai/) and am tackling the wild west that is adtech. Read more about what we're working on [here](https://stevenliss.substack.com/p/the-end-of-hypertext).

I'm passionate about building my own recommender system, to that end I am conducting research at the intersection of the predictive power of LLMs and reader attention spans under [Dr Saining Xie](https://www.sainingxie.com/). Read about [it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16EC56JutIllX72LfXd83zkla6yaMSdswdivo3DZrXHI/edit), feel free to highlight any single word that catches your ... attention. I like to read and am always on the verge of writing something. Check it [out](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NiihHS6UpGeFRC88_WU25MU7aCrhmTTu?usp=share_link).

Lastly, you can check out my photos [here](/photography).
